    "- A Decision Tree is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It's a supervised learning algorithm that is particularly useful for making decisions or predictions by visually representing a series of choices and their potential consequences. Decision Trees are widely used in various fields, including data mining, finance, healthcare, and more.\n",

    "- A decision tree is a structure that includes a root node, branches, and leaf nodes. Each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch denotes the outcome of a test, and each leaf node holds a class label. The topmost node in the tree is the root node.\n",
